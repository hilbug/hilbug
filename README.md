### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hilary (she/her/hers), an aspiring full stack developer currently working within the healthcare technology sector as a technical program manager. I would love to connect with other coding newbies and collaborate on a project!

:point_right: My personal tenets:
- Unconditional positive regard
- Do it right, not fast
- Communicate, Clarify, Care

ðŸ“« You can find me at: 
- [My portfolio page](https://hilbug.github.io/)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hferraro/)

:crown: When I'm not working or coding, I am most likely doing one of these things: checking out the latest Royal news, reading historical fiction, or catching a travel show.
